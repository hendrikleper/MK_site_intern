Ana Victoria aka Vica Pacheco was born in Oaxaca, southern Mexico in 1993. She lives and works in Brussels.

Vica studied Art at La Esmeralda in MÃ©xico City before graduating from Villa Arson in 2017. Her artistic work is above all eclectic and energetic, regardless of her sources of inspiration and her concerns for mythological crossbreeding and sincretism, she likes to arrange the most heterogeneous or hazardous elements between them, to produce sound performances and installations . She has a practice rooted in music and sound art, but also a plastic practice going through ceramics and 3d animation.

In 2020 Vica Pacheco released her debut album [Symplegmata](https://kraak.bandcamp.com/album/symplegmata) on Kraak. One can read
> It transposes a exploration of unearthed sound narratives of a fully-fleshed mythology to unfurl biological fusions, hermaphrodite sexuality, the amalgamation of distinct beings into fully-realized entities using synthesized field recordings and manipulated vocals.

The successor [Fibre-Fusion](https://wabi-sabi-tapes.bandcamp.com/album/fibre-fusion) was released on cassette by wabi-sabi tapes (Lyon) in 2021. It continues her work on mutation and the energies that are released from new forms of life.
