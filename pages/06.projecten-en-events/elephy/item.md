[elephy](https://elephy.org) is a Brussels-based production and distribution platform for film and media art founded by four KASK alumni – Rebecca Jane Arthur, Chloë Delanghe, Eva Giolo and Christina Stuhlberger – in 2018. Elephy supports its productions by providing them with an artist-run, professional framework which ensures that they can be made with the greatest artistic freedom.
