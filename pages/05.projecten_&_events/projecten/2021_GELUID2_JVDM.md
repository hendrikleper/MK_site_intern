# SOUND in Visual Art
### 3 days of individual coaching of projects with Johan Vandermaelen    
### Wednesday May 5th to Friday 7th – Media Art studio

Johan Vandermaelen (°Brussels 1962) is a composer, improvisor, maker of instruments and installations. He also works as a sound scenographer and has been collaborating with numerous Belgian and foreign artists for quite some time.    
Last February he taught a workshop on Sound in Space, including theory on acoustics, perception, sonic phenomena and was getting our hands dirty and ears cleaned with diy speaker systems.

The focus of this three-day workshop shifts to your projects. Johan will put his knowledge and expertise at your disposal to see how your individual art projects can be optimized in terms of audio and sound. He can help with both the sound design and the presentation of the work (in regard of the sound).    
The workshop starts on Wednesday May 5th with pitches or brief presentations of your work for Johan and each other. This is followed, during the afternoon, by a feedback session with brief tips and advice by Johan. This first day is open for all selected participants.    
The following days will involve a schedule of one-on-one conversations, elaborated practical advice and more.

This will or might include an evaluation of:
* sound content
* spectral content (frequencies)
* dynamic range
* optimal distribution and spatial format
* optimal listening distances
* estimated emotional spectrum / impact
* choice of material
* different possible delivery formats
* installation advise

In preparation, it is advised to send a short description of your work (max. 1 A4) and a sound file (stereo wav. ) before Wednesday, April 28th to johan.vandermaelen-at-gmail.com & Hendrik.leper-at-hogent.be
This will enable us to make a selection (if necessary) and start in a thorough way on Wednesday.
