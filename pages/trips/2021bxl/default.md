# BEZOEK aan ARGOS & iMAL, gesprek met Aay Liparoto

Dag allen,

Fairuz en ik willen jullie graag uitnodigen voor een uitstap naar Brussel op woensdag 1 december voor een bezoek aan iMal en Argos en een gesprek met Aay Liparoto, kunstenaar en oud-student. Zie onderaan.  

We spreken af op het centrale plein voor station Gent Sint-Pieters om 13:10 (voor de trein van 13:23) of rechtsreeks aan iMal om 14:30. We zijn terug in Gent rond 18u.    

De toegang voor de tentoonstellingen wordt betaald via de bijzondere studiekosten. Jullie staan zelf in voor de verplaatsingsonkosten.

Wegens covid willen we de groep beperken tot 20 deelnemers. Laat ons dus snel weten indien je mee wil gaan. Indien je rechtstreeks naar iMal gaat weten we dat ook graag op voorhand.

Let op: Voor beide tentoonstellingen is er een Covid Safe Ticket vereist!

Groeten,
Fairuz en Hendrik


Hello everyone,

We will meet at the central square in front of Gent Sint-Pieters station at 13:10 (for the 13:23 train) or right at iMal at 14:30. We will be back in Ghent around 6 pm.    

Entrance to the exhibitions is paid for through the special student fee. You are responsible for the travel expenses.

Greetings,
Fairuz and Hendrik

What does it mean to love in the digital age? How are digital interfaces reshaping our personal relationships? What do new technologies imply for the future of the romantic sphere? How do screens affect our sexual intimacy and our desire for connection?

Born in Morocco in 1982, Hamza Halloubi has lived and worked in Brussels for many years. In his work, Halloubi observes reality through a precise yet poetic gaze.

This solo exhibition originates from the idea of silence, which the artist defines as “an empty space of discourse,” a concept he consecutively translates to the medium of video. How can one make visible what usually lives in the interstices of the dominant image?

### [Flatform: History of a tree](https://www.argosarts.org/event/flatform-history-of-a-tree)
History of a Tree is shot from roots to spire by one, seemingly continuous, drone-made take. With a non-human living organism as its monumental protagonist standing proudly at the centre of this portrait, the film evokes the existence of a wider territory without ever showing it. The Oak of the Hundred Knights rooted 900 years ago close to the town of Tricase in Salento (Southern Italy). It is an immovable, vital and perennial part of a vast, constantly changing landscape. With this film, Flatform composes a symphony of forms, speech, and music.

### [Sara Sejin Chang (Sara van der Heide): Four Months, Four Million Light Years](https://www.argosarts.org/event/sara-sejin-chang-sara-van-der-heide-four-months-four-million-light-years-1)
Brussels-based Korean/Dutch artist Sara Sejin Chang (Sara van der Heide)’s Four Months, Four Million Light Years (2020) presents a shamanic healing journey through space and time. This immersive film installation addresses the colonial narratives behind transnational and transracial adoption, through the historical relations between The Netherlands and Korea.

## [Aay Liparoto](https://www.aliparoto.com/)

Aay Liparoto  [1987°, USA] was educated in Visual Arts in London and completed a MFA at KASK with a seductive reflection on normative gender performance with the 9 month long daily performance project 'Andrew has His Period' and the movie 'Andrew a Strong Courageous Warrior'.

> A. Liparoto studied the construction of identity and left her womanhood to  subsequently transform into a male and androgynous person. Filmed over nine months in the maker’s apartment, real life gradually becomes a performance in which it seems almost impossible to escape fiction’s power.

Aay uses long term performance as a form of research to examine the power in the banal. Their output is predominately video, text and performance, working with accessible technology, personal digital archives and DIY strategies to reflect on the mechanics of everyday life. In both their solo and collaborative practice, they are currently focused on feminist co–authorship as a method for resisting the oversimplification of mainstream narratives of historically marginalised voices.

They are currently in development of 360°cinematic virtual reality work, [Small Acts Of Violence](https://www.aliparoto.com/small-acts-of-violence), which is focused on the entanglement of love and violence in primary relationships, in production with ARGOS.
