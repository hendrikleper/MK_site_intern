### [Hamza Halloubi: You left me my lips, and they shape words, even in silence](https://www.argosarts.org/event/hamza-halloubi-you-left-me-my-lips-and-they-shape-words-even-in-silence-1)
Born in Morocco in 1982, Hamza Halloubi has lived and worked in Brussels for many years. In his work, Halloubi observes reality through a precise yet poetic gaze.

This solo exhibition originates from the idea of silence, which the artist defines as “an empty space of discourse,” a concept he consecutively translates to the medium of video. How can one make visible what usually lives in the interstices of the dominant image?

### [Flatform: History of a tree](https://www.argosarts.org/event/flatform-history-of-a-tree)
History of a Tree is shot from roots to spire by one, seemingly continuous, drone-made take. With a non-human living organism as its monumental protagonist standing proudly at the centre of this portrait, the film evokes the existence of a wider territory without ever showing it. The Oak of the Hundred Knights rooted 900 years ago close to the town of Tricase in Salento (Southern Italy). It is an immovable, vital and perennial part of a vast, constantly changing landscape. With this film, Flatform composes a symphony of forms, speech, and music.

### [Sara Sejin Chang (Sara van der Heide): Four Months, Four Million Light Years](https://www.argosarts.org/event/sara-sejin-chang-sara-van-der-heide-four-months-four-million-light-years-1)
Brussels-based Korean/Dutch artist Sara Sejin Chang (Sara van der Heide)’s Four Months, Four Million Light Years (2020) presents a shamanic healing journey through space and time. This immersive film installation addresses the colonial narratives behind transnational and transracial adoption, through the historical relations between The Netherlands and Korea.

## [Aay Liparoto](https://www.aliparoto.com/)

Aay Liparoto  [1987°, USA] was educated in Visual Arts in London and completed a MFA at KASK with a seductive reflection on normative gender performance with the 9 month long daily performance project 'Andrew has His Period' and the movie 'Andrew a Strong Courageous Warrior'.

> A. Liparoto studied the construction of identity and left her womanhood to  subsequently transform into a male and androgynous person. Filmed over nine months in the maker’s apartment, real life gradually becomes a performance in which it seems almost impossible to escape fiction’s power.

Aay uses long term performance as a form of research to examine the power in the banal. Their output is predominately video, text and performance, working with accessible technology, personal digital archives and DIY strategies to reflect on the mechanics of everyday life. In both their solo and collaborative practice, they are currently focused on feminist co–authorship as a method for resisting the oversimplification of mainstream narratives of historically marginalised voices.

They are currently in development of 360°cinematic virtual reality work, [Small Acts Of Violence](https://www.aliparoto.com/small-acts-of-violence), which is focused on the entanglement of love and violence in primary relationships, in production with ARGOS.

## Beursschouwburg
**20:30 A. Ortsstraat 20-28 1000 BXL**
### [PRISM van Eléonore Yameogo, Rosine Mfetgo en An van. Dienderen](https://beursschouwburg.be/en/events/rosine-mbakam-eleonore-yameogo-and-an-van-dienderen-prism/) - filmscreening
In this chain-letter Gesamtkunstwerk, three filmmakers explore the poetic and political significance of light as it relates to skin colour.
PRISM departs from the perspective that the photographic media are technologically and ideologically biased, favouring Caucasian skin. Its three filmmakers pool their distinctive approaches and experiences to explore the relation between skin colour and cinematography, between white-centric privilege and the photographic media.

## Miry (& Voo?uit)
**19:30 Biezekapelstraat 9, 9000 Gent**
### [RUISKAMER #3: Trio Thielemans, Ambarchi & Charlemagne Palestine / Oren Ambarchi solo](https://miryconcertzaal.be/trio-thielemans-ambarchi-charlemagne-palestine-eric-thielemans-oren-ambarchi/)
Avant-garde giants pay tribute to Mika Vainio
The late Finnish artist Mika Vainio was an electronica pioneer and one half of the legendary underground duo Pan Sonic. Going by Ø or simply Mika Vainio, the musician experimented with atmospheric ambient, minimal techno and everything in between. In 2013, Vainio was invited to Les Ateliers Claus in Brussels, where he collaborated and performed with percussionist Eric Theielemans and avant-garde phenomenon Charlemagne Palestine.
The music they created has been compiled to create a record, released in 2020. To mark the release and pay tribute to the man himself, who passed away in 2017, Thielemans and Palestine are bringing the recordings to life during this RUISKAMER, together with Oren Ambarchi.
